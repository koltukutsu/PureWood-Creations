### products

- Only Active products are shown. Draft products will not be shown until they are marked as Active.

- Active products can still be hidden and not seen by navigating the site, by adding a nextjs-frontend-hidden tag on the product. This tag will also tell search engines to not index or crawl the product, but the product will still be directly accessible by url. This feature allows "secret" products to only be accessed by people you share the url with.

- Product options and option combinations are driven from Shopify options and variants. When selecting options on the product detail page, other option and variant combinations will be visually validated and verified for availability, like Amazon does.
Products that are Active but no quantity remaining will still be displayed on the site, but will be marked as "out of stock". The ability to add the product to the cart is disabled.


### collections
**NOTE** collections are such things that they allow us to separeate the products into categories such as Kids, Toddlers, New-Borns and so on....

- All available collections will show on the search page as filters on the left, with one exception.

- Any collection names that start with the word hidden will not show up on the headless front end. Next.js Commerce comes pre-configured to look for two hidden collections. Collections were chosen for this over tags so that order of products could be controlled (collections allow for manual ordering).

- Create the following collections:

- Hidden: Homepage Featured Items — Products in this collection are displayed in the three featured blocks on the homepage.
Hidden: Homepage Carousel — Products in this collection are displayed in the auto-scrolling carousel section on the homepage.

# Next.js Commerce

A high-performance, server-rendered Next.js App Router ecommerce application.

This template uses React Server Components, Server Actions, `Suspense`, `useOptimistic`, and more.

<h3 id="v1-note"></h3>

## Providers

Vercel will only be actively maintaining a Shopify version [as outlined in our vision and strategy for Next.js Commerce](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/pull/966).

Vercel is happy to partner and work with any commerce provider to help them get a similar template up and running and listed below. Alternative providers should be able to fork this repository and swap out the `lib/shopify` file with their own implementation while leaving the rest of the template mostly unchanged.

## Integrations

Integrations enable upgraded or additional functionality for Next.js Commerce

- [Orama](https://github.com/oramasearch/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://vercel-commerce.oramasearch.com/))

  - Upgrades search to include typeahead with dynamic re-rendering, vector-based similarity search, and JS-based configuration.
  - Search runs entirely in the browser for smaller catalogs or on a CDN for larger.

- [React Bricks](https://github.com/ReactBricks/nextjs-commerce-rb) ([Demo](https://nextjs-commerce.reactbricks.com/))
  - Edit pages, product details, and footer content visually using [React Bricks](https://www.reactbricks.com) visual headless CMS.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

<details>
